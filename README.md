# Chazz UI – React UI Kit

Uses styled-components and styled-icons for styling. Inspired by great component libraries from Ant Design and Shopify Polaris. React Chazz UI is not available via NPM yet, but feel free to clone and play around!

- `npm run storybook` – Runs Storybook for documentation and component API testing.
- `npm start` – Runs v1 playground (deprecated, probably buggy, planning to remove in future)
